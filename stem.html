        <h1>Why women are so important in STEM?</h1>
        <h3>(science, technology, engineering and mathematics)</h3>
        <p> Firstly, getting more women into STEM could both reduce the gender wage gap and ensure that single mothers don’t have to struggle to put food on the table. Not only are there currently more jobs in STEM than in any other industry, but most of these high-tech jobs are high-paying, as well.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Secondly, women’s health is also an important reason. For generations, the model used in biomedical research to design drugs and products has been an average size male. Even the rats used in these experiments were male. It just failed to register that adding sex as a variable for tests could be a possibility, since women are physiologically quite different and need to administered different drugs and dosages.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Thirdly,women participation in any scientific and technological process would increase the usage of the products and solutions being created and success of their application. Use of gender discipline in creating science and technology is an important aspect of unbiased successful research or product development. Employing different perspectives and abilities can enrich the creativity and insight of products.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Lastly,unless women are involved in the product development process, there is a lot amiss for technology companies. They might end up with lean mean companies with high valuations, but they may not end up being valuable to the gender that uses the technology the most.</p>

            HeForShe is a solidarity campaign for the advancement of women initiated by UN Women. Its goal is to engage men and boys as agents of change by encouraging them to take action against negative inequalities faced by women and girls.[2][3] Grounded in the idea that gender equality is an issue that affects all people—socially, economically and politically—it seeks to actively involve men and boys in a movement that was originally conceived as "a struggle for women by women".

           Women for Women International (WfWI) is a nonprofit humanitarian organization that provides practical and moral support to women survivors of war. WfWI helps such women rebuild their lives after war’s devastation through a year-long tiered program that begins with direct financial aid and emotional counseling and includes life skills (e.g., literacy, numeracy) training if necessary, rights awareness education, health education, job skills training and small business development.
